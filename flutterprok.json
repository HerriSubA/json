This wish, however, does not stem from a desire to be recognized by others; rather, Minoru does everything he can to blend in with the crowd.

Yet when Minoru finds himself in a truck accident, his ambitions seemingly come to a sudden end. In his final moments, he laments his powerlessness—no matter how much he trained, there was nothing he could do to overcome his human limitations."},
